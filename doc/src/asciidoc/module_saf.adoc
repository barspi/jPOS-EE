=== SAF

The `SAF` (Store And Forward) module is responsible for managing and retransmitting messages, ensuring reliable and resilient message processing.
It provides a mechanism to temporarily store messages when the network or MUX (Multiplexer) is unavailable and forwards them automatically when connectivity is restored.

==== Key Features

* Persistent message storage using configurable storage mechanisms (e.g., `JESpace`).
* Automatic retry for message forwarding based on user-defined configurations.
* Support for valid and retry response codes for retransmission logic.
* Automatic handling of expired messages and maximum number of retransmission.
* Thread-safe operations using jPOS's space-based architecture.
* Logging and status monitoring.

==== Configuration
The `SAF` module is configured using a Q2 XML descriptor file. Below is an example configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<saf name='saf' logger='Q2' realm='saf' class='org.jpos.saf.SAF'>
 <property name='space' value='je:saf' />
 <property name='mux' value='mux' />
 <property name='flag-retransmissions' value='no'>
  if MTI is in list, messages would be retransmitted as xxx1
 </property>
 <property name='initial-delay' value='60000' />
 <property name='inter-message-delay' value='1000' />
 <property name='wait-for-response' value='60000' />
 <property name='max-retransmissions' value='1000' />
 <property name='expire-after' value='86400'>
  in seconds
 </property>
 <property name='valid-response-codes' value='*' />
 <property name='retry-response-codes' value='91,ZZ' />
</saf>
----

===== Available Properties

- `space`
Defines the persistence space where messages are stored. (e.g., `je:saf`)

- `mux`
Specifies the `MUX` instance used for sending messages.

- `flag-retransmissions`
If set to `yes`, messages with specific MTIs are retransmitted as `xxx1`.

- `initial-delay`
Sets the delay (in milliseconds) before starting the SAF process (default: `30,000` ms).

- `inter-message-delay`
Delay (in milliseconds) between subsequent messages (default: `1,000` ms).

- `wait-for-response`
Time (in milliseconds) to wait for a response after sending a message (default: `60,000` ms).

- `max-retransmissions`
Maximum number of times a message can be retransmitted (default: `0`, unlimited).

- `expire-after`
The expiration time for a message (in seconds). Expired messages are removed from the queue (default: `0`, unlimited).

- `valid-response-codes`
A list of response codes considered valid (default: `00`). Use `*` to accept all response codes.

- `retry-response-codes`
List of response codes that trigger message retransmission (optional).

- `pre-message-delay`
Delay before moving messages from a delayed queue to the main queue (default: `0`).

==== Example Usage

The following example demonstrates how to use the `SAF` module in your application to queue and process messages:

[source,java]
----
import org.jpos.iso.ISOMsg;
import org.jpos.saf.SAF;

// Obtain an instance of the SAF service
SAF saf = SAF.getSAF("saf");

// Create a sample message
ISOMsg msg = new ISOMsg();
msg.setMTI("0200");
msg.set(4, "1000");
msg.set(11, "123456");
msg.set(41, "000001");

// Send the message
saf.send(msg);
----

==== Inner Class: Entry

The `Entry` class represents a queued message and its metadata.

===== Attributes
* `msg`: The `ISOMsg` object representing the message.
* `time`: The timestamp when the message was added to the queue.
* `count`: The number of transmission attempts for the message.
* `responseKey`: The key used to store the response in the space (optional).
* `responseTimeout`: The timeout in milliseconds for the response (optional).
* `wipePreviousResponse`: Whether to clear previous responses for the same key.

===== Methods

====== Public Methods
* `void send(ISOMsg msg)`: Queues a message for transmission.
* `void send(ISOMsg msg, String responseKey, long responseTimeout, boolean wipe)`: Queues a message for transmission with additional response options.
* `String getStatus()`: Retrieves the current status of the SAF service.
* `static SAF getSAF(String name)`: Retrieves an instance of `SAF` from the `NameRegistrar`.

====== Private Methods
* `Entry send(Entry entry)`: Handles the actual transmission of a message.
* `boolean shouldIgnore(Entry entry)`: Determines if a message should be ignored (expired or max retransmissions reached).
* `LogEvent createLogEvent(String type, Entry entry)`: Creates a log event for a specific entry.

==== How It Works

* **Initialization**: The `SAF` service reads its configuration and sets up the necessary persistence space and `MUX` instance.
* **Message Queueing**: Messages are queued into the configured persistence space.
* **Message Processing**: Messages are sent sequentially based on the configuration (e.g., delay between messages and retry logic).
* **Response Handling**: If a response is received, it is validated against the `valid-response-codes`. If invalid, the message is retried based on the `retry-response-codes` property.
* **Message discarding**: If a message expires or exceeds the maximum retransmission attempts, it is discarded.

==== Thread Safety

The `SAF` module is thread-safe, allowing concurrent processing of messages. Synchronization mechanisms are implemented where needed to ensure safe interaction with shared resources.

==== Logging and Monitoring

The module integrates with the jPOS `Logger` and `LogEvent` utilities to provide extensive monitoring capabilities:

* Logs transmission attempts and responses.
* Reports expired or ignored messages.
* Provides status information using the `getStatus()` method.
